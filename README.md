### How to run

* Import project dependencies with Gradle
* download model from g-drive watch [model.txt](https://github.com/BadlyDrunkScotsman/FaceMaskDetection-Yolo-Dl4j/blob/main/model.txt)
* If you own an NVIDIA card with a CUDA support you can enable the usage in Gradle file

### Training
* If you wish to use your own data simply paste it into the /data folder, link for an example set is in [data.txt](https://github.com/BadlyDrunkScotsman/FaceMaskDetection-Yolo-Dl4j/blob/main/data/data.txt)
* The project is using a Keras Yolo data-format

If model.zip isn't available in project then root directory then the training will start.
